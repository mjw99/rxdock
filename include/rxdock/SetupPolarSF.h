// Pseudo-scoring function who's only role is to setup the receptor local
// neighbour density property and store in each atom's User1Value
// This SF should be registered with the workspace BEFORE any SF which needs
// this property (e.g. HBOND, IONIC) to ensure that User1Value is calculated
// before being used. Scoring function is disabled by default.
